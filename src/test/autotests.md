- Tests must be correct and logical, conforming to the actual class API.
- Test environment must be described in `application-test.properties`. Tests must work in isolation with production environment.
- Tests must cover all scenarios: positive, negative, and edge cases.
- Non-existent methods must not be used.
- Before and after each test, repositories must be cleared to ensure test independence.
- There should be no duplicate checks or unnecessary logic.
- Parametrized tests must be used where applicable to reduce code duplication.
- Test data must be chosen deliberately and be realistic. Filler test data is unacceptable - it must carry meaning.
- Test names must follow the testSomething_WhenSomething_ThenSomething format.
- The message parameter in assertEquals, assertTrue, etc. must give developers a clear understanding of what is happening in the test.
- Each test must be self-contained and easily readable.
- There must be no unused variables.
- Variable names must clearly indicate their content.
- Code must adhere to common code style conventions. Line length should not exceed 120 characters, but unnecessary line breaks are undesirable.
